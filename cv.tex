\section{summary}
Provide a summary of your experience. It should read like a paragraph and be easy to follow. Your last sentence should state what you are looking for in terms of career opportunity. Don’t go beyond four lines and don’t use bullet points for this. Make sure the last sentence uses up as much space horizontally so that you have the greatest opportunity to make an impact.
